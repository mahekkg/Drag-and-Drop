# Drag and Drop

This project is made as an assignment. The project implements a simple drag and drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to drag and drop items between two containers and provides a "Reset" button to restore the initial state of the containers.

## Features

- Drag and drop items: Users can drag and drop the items from the left container to the right container.
- Reset functionality: Clicking the "Reset" button restores the initial state of the containers, allowing users to start over.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You will see two containers: the left container with draggable items and the right container for dropping items.
4. To drag an item, click and hold on an item in the left container, and drag it to the right container.
5. To reset the state, click the "Reset" button. This will clear the right container and restore the initial state of the left container.

## Customization

- Adding more items: You can easily add more draggable items by modifying the HTML in the left container. Just duplicate the existing `<div class="list" draggable="true">Item</div>` elements and change the text as desired.
- Styling: The visual appearance of the containers and items can be customized by modifying the CSS in the `style.css` file.
